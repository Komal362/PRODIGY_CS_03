--Password Complexity Checker--
A password complexity checker, also known as a password security checker, is a tool that evaluates how difficult a password is to guess.
It helps users create stronger passwords and improve their online security.
---How it works----
The checker analyzes the password using algorithms 
It considers factors like the number of characters, the combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and how unique the password is 
The checker ranks the password's strength, often using categories like "weak," "fair," and "strong" 
It may also show the result graphically, like with a color-coded bar
